  This utility lets you draw using your laptop's touchpad.
  Pressing any key or clicking the touchpad will finish the drawing.
  Your touchpad will not control the cursor while drawing, though external mice should still work.
  It has support for both X11 (all desktop environments), and Wayland (just Gnome at the moment).
